# Wired Client Source Code

This repository hosts Wired Client source code. You will find an Xcode project named "WiredClient.xcworkspace" that contains a Wired Client target ready to deploy a 10.13+ compatible application (64-bit).

## Prerequisites

- Mac OS X 10.13+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Homebrew 1.8+
- CocoaPods 1.5+

## How to compile Wired Client

0. Install dependencies using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
		
		brew install mogenerator cocoapods
		
2. Get sources on GitHub:

		git clone https://github.com/profdrluigi/WiredClient.git

		cd WiredClient
		git clone https://github.com/ProfDrLuigi/libwired vendor/WiredFrameworks/libwired
		
5. Install pods:

6. Open `WiredClient.xcworkspace` with Xcode

8. Launch Build, Wired Client.app should launch automatically when finished


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error during compilation with Xcode crying about `wired.h` not found, got to Build Product folder and rename "libwired/" directory to "wired/". Then try to build again.
